# *Emowise: Personalized AI for Emotional WellBeing*

### About the Project
At the heart of Emo-Wise are advanced technologies like collaborative filtering, natural language processing, and deep learning. These tools will allow the system in understanding emotional cues with accuracy and delivering highly relevant guidance in the real time. Beyond the technology, Emo-Wise prioritizes user privacy, ethical AI practices and ensuring that it works for a wide range of people. 


## Code Implementation 

In order to understand the project, you are supposed to run training file that allows you to get pickle files to save and then go to main.py file to get the final application.
The pickle files are stored in the **Models** folder and jupyter notebook files are stored in **utils** folder.


## Dependencies

In order to update anaconda,use the following command
```sh
  conda update --all
```

## Clone the repo
The repository should be cloned using 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DhivyaSriLingala/EGN6216---AI-Systems-Dhivya-Sri-Lingala.git
```
## Understanding all the files
Inside the Emowise Folder in our repository you will find 2 folders 
- one for text data
- one for visual data

You are supposed to run text data and visual data related code files separately in order to get personalized recommendation individually


## Future Scope
The emotional recognition can be done on vocal data also.
The recommendation can be made individually for every person with reference to the food they like,the hobbies they have and by detecting the mood they are in.
